/**
 * Regression guard for the DSH peer ranges in `package.json`.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS — read before weakening it:
 *
 * DSH enforces the `peerDependencies` of a *bundle* at boot, and a bundle whose
 * peers are unsatisfied is skipped **whole** — silently. The plugin does not
 * half-load: no provider, no settings card, not even the usage route. Nothing
 * in this repository noticed when that happened for real:
 *
 *   - `tsc` passes, because the ranges are plain strings;
 *   - all 345 unit tests pass, because the plugin's own code is untouched;
 *   - `pnpm install` passes, because the devDependency pins satisfied the range
 *     that the range itself got wrong;
 *   - CI stays green.
 *
 * The failure is only visible on a user's machine, as "the plugin vanished".
 * That is the exact shape of the 2.3.1 → DSH 0.2.0-rc.1 breakage this file
 * exists to prevent from recurring:
 *
 *     >=0.1.7-rc.1 <0.2.0-0     # intended: "not 0.2.0 yet"
 *
 * That upper bound reads naturally but is **wrong**: in SemVer, `0.2.0-rc.1`
 * sorts BELOW `0.2.0-0`, so `<0.2.0-0` excludes the entire 0.2.0 PRERELEASE
 * line, not just the 0.2.0 release. The first 0.2.0 prerelease the user
 * installed therefore dropped the plugin. `<0.3.0-0` is the correct spelling
 * for "this minor line and later prereleases, but not the next minor line".
 *
 * Two rules keep this guard honest:
 *
 *  1. **Mirror the host, do not invent.** DSH evaluates ranges with
 *     `semver.satisfies(runtime, range, { includePrerelease: true })`
 *     (see `@deepseek-ai/dsh-app-boot` → plugin-compatibility). Without that
 *     option a prerelease runtime fails EVERY range, including the correct one,
 *     so a guard using the default options would reject the fixed manifest and
 *     teach the wrong lesson. The option is applied below and asserted on.
 *  2. **Assert the boundaries, not the spelling.** The probes below name the
 *     versions whose membership is the whole point: the oldest supported line,
 *     the runtime actually installed, and the next minor line that must stay
 *     out. A guard that only checked "0.2.0-rc.1 works" would still pass if
 *     someone widened the range to `>=0.1.7-rc.1` with no upper bound at all.
